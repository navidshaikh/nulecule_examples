This is an atomic application based on the nulecule specification. Kubernetes is the currently the only supported provider. You'll need to run this from a workstation that has the atomic command and kubectl client that can connect to a kubernetes master.

It is 3 a tier application based on redis, postgresql and gitlab. This is also an example of a Nulecule example having multiple tier artifacts rather using graphs.

### Option 1: Interactive

Run the image. It will automatically use kubernetes as the orchestration provider.  It will prompt for all parameters in the Nulecule file that do not have default values:

    $ [sudo] atomic run projectatomic/gitlab-centos7-atomicapp

## Option 2: Unattended

1. Create the file `answers.conf` with these contents:

    This sets up the values for the configurable parameters and indicates that kubernetes should be the orchestration provider.

        [general]
        namespace = default
        provider = kubernetes

        [redis]
        image=swordphilic/redis:latest

        [postgresql]
        image=swordphilic/postgresql:latest

        [gitlab]
        image=swordphilic/gitlab:latest
        DB_USER=gitlab
        DB_PASS=password
        DB_NAME=gitlab_production
        # port on the node where Gitlab over HTTP will be accessible - valid range 30000-32667
        NODE_PORT=30000

1. Run the application from the current working directory

        $ [sudo] atomic run projectatomic/gitlab-centos7-atomicapp

### Option 3: Install and Run

You may want to download the application, review the configuraton and parameters as specified in the Nulecule file, and edit the answerfile before running the application.

1. Download the application files using `atomic install`

        [sudo] atomic install projectatomic/gitlab-centos7-atomicapp

1. Rename `answers.conf.sample`

        mv answers.conf.sample answers.conf

1. Edit `answers.conf`, review files if desired and then run

        $ [sudo] atomic run projectatomic/gitlab-centos7-atomicapp

## Test
Any of these approaches should create kubernetes replication controllers, pods and services.

Gitlab is web app, to test if its functioning we can access it in browser.
We have configured the app on ADB port 30000 (see answer.conf). You can access
the app using the IP of ADB box at port 30000 or by forwarding the port 30000 of ADB box to
host machine port.

To test out if app is running and intialized properly (run following inside ADB)
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
gitlab-0nax4       1/1       Running   0          15m
postgresql-ytsy5   1/1       Running   0          15m
redis-s5cge        1/1       Running   0          15m

$ kubectl logs gitlab-0nax4

```

To forward port `30000` of ADB box to host machine port `30000`, add following line your Vagrantfile

```
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 30000, host: 30000, auto_correct: true

```

and run following command to apply changes in updated Vagrantfile

```
vagrant reload
```

Observe logs as shown above if app is configured and ready to accept connections, once it is ready you should be able to access the app at host browser using address

```
http://127.0.0.1:30000
```

For first time login you can use following credentials:

 - username: root
 - password: 5iveL!fe
